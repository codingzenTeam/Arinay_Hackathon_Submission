Calculator By Arinay Mahendru

My Calculator has 2 verison for windows and macos

Due to differences in system styling the windows version couldnt be run on mac and vice versa 

Please run the macos and windows calculator on their respective machines

The calculator also has a problem calculator where you can search expression or equations on google

Note: The "=" in the problem calculator is not for calculating its there to create equation to get the result the search button must be pressed
